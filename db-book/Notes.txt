 How an sql query is evaluated
-------------------------------
 
 1. Generate a Cartesian product of the relations listed in the from clause
 2. Apply the predicates specified in the where clause on the result of Step 1.
 3. For each tuple in the result of Step 2, output the attributes (or results of
    expressions) specified in the select clause.

/*
Join operations: 
1- join ... using :
	a form of natural join that only requires values to match
    on specified attributes
    --------
    select*
    from t1 join t2 using(column ...)
    ...
    --------
    
2- join ... on : 
	allows a genral predicate (condition) over the raltions being joined.
    the result of the join contains tuples matched from the twp relations
    and preserves duplicated culumns from the relations 
    --------
    select*
    from t1 join t2 on t1.c1 = t2.c2
    where 
    ...
    --------
    it is exactly the same as 
    --------
    select*
    from t1, t2 
    where t1.c1 = t2.c2 and
    ...
    --------
  Outer joins: 
  extended version of the natural join that preserves non mathed tuples
  from the two relations filling them with null values
- 3) natural outer joins
		select*
        from t1 natural [left | right | full] outer join t2 
		--- the full is not supported in mysql
- 4) the 'on' clause with outer joins.
		select*
        from t1 [left | rigth | full] join t2 on < predicate >
	----
    select*
    from t1 natural left outer join t2 
    
    is equivalent to 
    select*
    from t1 left outer join t2 on <t1.c1 = t2.c2
