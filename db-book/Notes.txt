 How an sql query is evaluated
-------------------------------
 
 1. Generate a Cartesian product of the relations listed in the from clause
 2. Apply the predicates specified in the where clause on the result of Step 1.
 3. For each tuple in the result of Step 2, output the attributes (or results of
    expressions) specified in the select clause.
